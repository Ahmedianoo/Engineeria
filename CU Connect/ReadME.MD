# Project Database 2024/12/29

Cairo University Faculty (CUFE) has a significantly substantial number of students, organizing such numbers, generally, is tiresome, keeping track of every project is a hustle for the professors and Teaching Assistants (TA). So, the main objective of our project is to help the TA’s monitor the teams assigned to them, the professors monitor their TA’s, as well as for the students to have fun and get to connect. Furthermore, the students can get to communicate with the TA’s, form connections with other students, and organize activities together. The professors get to create the subject they teach, assign TAs to students, assign grades to students, see the statistics of grades, handle conflict between TAs and students, and review students’ feedback on the TA’s.
